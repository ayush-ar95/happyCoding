/*
    protected derivation :- The protected access modifier is similar to the private access modifier in the sense that it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of a friend class.
    The difference is that the class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well.

                            public derivation       private derivation      protected derivation
