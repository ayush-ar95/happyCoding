/*
    properties of friends function :-
    1. not in the scope of class. (means this function is not the part of that class)
    2. since it is not in the scope of the class, it cannot be called from the object of that class and dot operator. c1.sumComplex() is invalid statement.
    3. can be invoked without the help of any objects.
    4. usually contains objects as arguments.
    5. can be declared anywhere in public or private section of the class.
    6. it can't access the members directly by their names and need object_name.member_name to access any member.
    7. Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
